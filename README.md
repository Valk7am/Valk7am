 Trying to build cool things, and maybe understand them later.

## 👋 Yo, I'm Mahmoud

A developer who’s **half debugging**, **half panicking**, and **100% vibing with new ideas**.  
I code like I read maps: upside down, squinting, and with coffee stains.

---

## 💭 Currently

- 🧠 Breaking things I don’t understand... yet  
- ⚙️ Messing with JavaScript, GSAP, WordPress, scroll weirdness  
- 🤹‍♂️ Juggling freelance chaos, side projects, and caffeine

## ⚠️ I Don’t “Vibe Code”

> I don’t throw stuff at the wall and pray it runs.  
> I build with intent, I debug with precision, and I think before I type.  
> Yes, I use AI tools — but they don’t write my brain.  
> They’re just accelerators, not architects.  
>  
> If you're here expecting copilot-driven spaghetti or feel-good guesswork, you're in the wrong repo.

## 🛠️ Tools I Fight With

`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript` • `jQuery` • `GSAP` • `WordPress`  
`PHP` • `Python` • `Linux` • `Java` • `LLAMA` • `OpenAI Models`  
...and the occasional `what the hell` moment

## 🪑 Vibes

- 🗞️ Reading docs like newspapers on the ground  
- 💻 Coding while wondering if I should’ve just sold falafel  
- ☕ Coffee + Milk > Everything

## 📡 Contact?

You’ll find me where the **website is down** and the **Linux server is on fire**.  
Still setting things up. ☠️
