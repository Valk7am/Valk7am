_**Trying to build cool things — understanding comes later (hopefully).**_

## 👋 Hey, I’m Mahmoud

A developer who’s usually **debugging something strange**, **chasing cool ideas**, and **running on caffeine**.  
I code like I’m solving a maze backwards — with coffee stains on the map and music in the background.

---

## 💭 What I’m Up To

- 🧠 Breaking stuff to learn how it works  
- 🌀 Exploring JavaScript, GSAP, WordPress, and scroll sorcery  
- 🤹‍♂️ Freelancing, prototyping, and trying not to forget what day it is

## ⚠️ Not a “Vibe Coder”

> I don’t just push buttons and hope for the best.  
> I build with purpose, debug with intent, and think before I type.  
> Yes, I use AI tools — they speed me up, but they don’t think for me.  
>  
> If you’re expecting AI-generated spaghetti, this ain’t it.

## 🛠️ Tools I Tinker With

`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript` • `jQuery` • `GSAP` • `WordPress`  
`PHP` • `Python` • `Linux` • `Java` • `LLAMA` • `OpenAI APIs`  
+ a healthy dose of **"wait... what?"**

## 🪑 The Vibes

- 🗞️ Reading docs like they’re ancient scrolls  
- 🧠 Coding while wondering if I should’ve just opened a falafel shop  
- ☕ Strong opinions, stronger coffee (milk mandatory)

## 📡 Contact?

You’ll probably catch me where something’s broken and the server’s throwing fire.  
Still piecing things together — but always down to build something cool.
