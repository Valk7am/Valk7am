  Trying to build cool things,
      and maybe understand them later.

👋 Yo, I'm Mahmoud
  A developer who’s half debugging, half panicking, and 100% vibing with new ideas.
  I code like I read maps: upside down, squinting, and with coffee stains.

💭 Currently:
  🧠 Breaking things I don’t understand... yet
  ⚙️ Messing with JavaScript, GSAP, WordPress, scroll weirdness
  🤹‍♂️ Juggling freelance chaos, side projects, and caffeine

⚠️ Note: I don’t "vibe code."
  I don’t throw stuff at the wall and pray it runs.
  I build with intent, I debug with precision, and I think before I type.
  Yes, I use AI tools — but they don’t write my brain.
  They’re just accelerators, not architects.
  If you're here expecting copilot-driven spaghetti or feel-good guesswork, you're in the wrong repo.

🛠️ Tools I Fight With:
  HTML • CSS • JavaScript • jQuery • GSAP • WordPress
  PHP • Python • Linux • Java • LLAMA • OpenAI Models
  ...and the occasional what moments
  
🪑 Vibes:
  🗞️ Reading docs like newspapers on the ground
  💻 Coding while wondering if I should’ve just sold falafel
  ☕ Coffee + Milk > Everything

📡 Contact?
  You’ll find me where the website is down and linux server is on fire.
  Setting things up :)
